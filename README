Semblance version 1.1
=====================

Semblance is eventually meant as a set of tools to manipulate assembly
code. Currently it only contains a single program:

dump - produce disassembly and other information from exectable files.
       Currently supports NE (New Executable) files as well as MZ (DOS
       executable) files. Support for the latter is somewhat shaky
       however (largely given the number of dirty tricks that DOS
       programmers were known to pull).


Installing
----------

To build, just run:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

To install to your computer, subsequently run "make install" as root.
