Semblance version 0.1
=====================

Semblance is eventually meant as a set of tools to manipulate assembly
code. Currently it only contains a single program:

dump - produce disassembly and other information from exectable files. 
       Originally written to support NE (New Executable) files due to the lack
       of any available tool. Currently supports MZ (aka DOS), NE, and PE
       (Portable Executable, i.e. Win32) executables.

Semblance is free software, released under the GNU GPL v3; see the file
LICENSE for the details.
